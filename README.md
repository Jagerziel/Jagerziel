# About Me | Software Engineer

Experience in front-end and back-end development.  A highly analytical, innovative, and strategic thinker who formulates and implements unique solutions to complex problems.  As a former multinational insurance broking and consulting professional, I approach software development with a keen perspective on business application as well as current and future needs. I have worked with complex multinationals in the Education, Food and Beverage, Financial, Real Estate, and Retail sectors as well as domestic Renewable Energy.
